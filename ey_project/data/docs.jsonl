{"id":"doc001","title":"EGFR Signaling in Lung Cancer","text":"EGFR (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor) is a key oncogenic driver in non-small cell lung cancer. Its activation leads to uncontrolled cell proliferation. EGFR inhibitors such as gefitinib and erlotinib have shown positive response in patients with EGFR mutations.","doi":"10.1000/example1"}
{"id":"doc002","title":"Role of IL-6 in Inflammatory Pathways","text":"IL-6 is a major pro-inflammatory cytokine that activates the JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway. Chronic upregulation of IL-6 is associated with autoimmune diseases and several cancers. Targeting IL-6 or JAK-STAT pathway may reduce inflammation and tumor progression.","doi":"10.1000/example2"}
{"id":"doc003","title":"Kinase Inhibitors in Oncology","text":"Small molecule kinase inhibitors block abnormal signaling pathways involved in cancer. Selective inhibition of cancer-specific kinases leads to reduced toxicity and improved therapeutic outcome. Combination therapy with kinase inhibitors increases overall survival rates.","doi":"10.1000/example3"}
{"id":"doc004","title":"TNF-alpha and Cell Survival","text":"TNF-alpha regulates apoptosis through NF-kB signaling. Overexpression of TNF-alpha contributes to inflammatory diseases. Blocking TNF-alpha using monoclonal antibodies reduces inflammation.","doi":"10.1000/example4"}
{"id":"doc005","title":"VEGF in Tumor Angiogenesis","text":"VEGF (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor) promotes blood vessel formation. Tumors overexpress VEGF to increase nutrient supply. Anti-VEGF drugs such as bevacizumab inhibit angiogenesis and restrict tumor growth.","doi":"10.1000/example5"}
